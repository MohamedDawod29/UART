# UART
A universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter (UART) is a computer hardware device for asynchronous serial communication in which the data transmission speeds are configurable. 
It sends data bits one by one, from the least significant to the most significant.
 A UART is usually an individual (or part of an) integrated circuit (IC) used for serial communications over a computer or peripheral device serial port. 
 One or more UART peripherals are commonly integrated in microcontroller chips. Specialized UARTs are used for automobiles, smart cards and SIMs.

 In recent years, UART has evolved to support advanced features like hardware and software flow control, allowing for efficient data flow management between devices. Additionally, advancements in UART technology have led to the development of higher data rates and improved error handling mechanisms, enhancing its overall reliability and performance.
